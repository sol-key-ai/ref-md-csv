# Dashboard Reference: SCSC Comprehensive Performance Framework (CPF) 2023-2024

This document summarizes the State Charter Schools Commission (SCSC) of Georgia's Comprehensive Performance Framework (CPF) for the 2023-2024 school year, based on the provided PDF. It outlines the standards and measures used to evaluate state charter schools.

## Overview and Purpose

* The CPF establishes clear, quantifiable, rigorous, and attainable standards for state charter school performance.
* It covers three key areas: Academic Performance, Financial Performance, and Operational Performance.
* The framework guides practice, assesses progress, and informs decisions like renewal or revocation throughout the charter term.
* **Fundamental Questions Addressed by the CPF:**
    * **Academic:** Is the school offering a better educational opportunity than the traditional local school?
    * **Financial:** Is the school fiscally viable and responsible?
    * **Organizational (Operations):** Is the organization effective, compliant, and well-run?

## All Schools Tab

* This tab displays school lists, enrollment, charter terms, grades served, and a map.
* **CPF Relevance:** The CPF provides the *framework* applied to evaluate *all* state charter schools across Georgia in academics, financials, and operations.
* **Note:** The CPF document itself *does not* contain specific school lists, current enrollment data by grade band, charter end terms, grades served, or map data. This information is sourced elsewhere for your dashboard.

## School Summary Tab

* This tab shows current designations (2023-2024), enrollment graphs, and designations over time.
* **CPF Relevance - Designations:** The CPF defines how overall annual designations are determined for each performance area:
    * **Academic:** Based on comparing school performance (achievement or growth) to its comparison zone (local schools/districts students are zoned for) using specific metrics. Designations include Exceeds, Meets, Approaches, Varied, or Does Not Meet Standards.
    * **Financial:** Based on points earned across Fiscal Viability (near-term & sustainability) and Fiscal Management & Oversight measures. Designations are Meets (80+ pts), Approaches (70-79 pts), or Does Not Meet (0-69 pts) Standards.
    * **Operational:** Based on points earned across six indicators measuring compliance with the charter contract and applicable laws/rules. Designations are Meets (80+ pts), Approaches (70-79 pts), or Does Not Meet (0-69 pts) Standards.
* **Note:** The CPF document *does not* contain specific school enrollment data or graphs. It focuses on the *methodology* for performance evaluation over time.

## Academics Tab

* This tab shows current academic designations, scores, comparison scores, and trends.
* **CPF Relevance (Section I):**
    * **Fundamental Question:** Is the school offering a better educational opportunity than the traditional local school?
    * **Indicators:** Performance is measured using:
        * Indicator 1: Grade Band Measures
        * Indicator 2: Schoolwide Measures
    * **Metrics:** Key metrics derived from the College and Career Readiness Performance Index (CCRPI) and Value-Added Model include:
        * CCRPI Content Mastery
        * CCRPI Progress (student growth)
        * CCRPI Grade Band Score
        * Value-Added Model impact scores
    * **Comparison:** School performance is compared against its "comparison zone" (the schools/districts students would otherwise attend). Calculations for comparison zones (district and school level) and whole school scores are detailed.
    * **Designations:** Determined by whether the school outperforms, performs as well as, or performs below its comparison zone on the specified metrics, potentially varying by grade band. A school only needs to outperform on *one* measure (Indicator 1 or Indicator 2) to meet standards overall.

## Financials Tab

* This tab shows current financial designations, scores, comparison scores, and trends.
* **CPF Relevance (Section II):**
    * **Fundamental Question:** Is the school fiscally viable and responsible?
    * **Indicators:**
        * Indicator 1: Fiscal Viability (Near-term health & long-term sustainability)
        * Indicator 2: Fiscal Management & Oversight (Compliance & responsibility)
    * **Metrics (Indicator 1 - Viability - 100 points total):**
        * *Near-Term:* Current Ratio, Unrestricted Days Cash, Annual Debt to Income, Default status.
        * *Sustainability:* Efficiency Margin (3-year), Debt to Asset Ratio.
    * **Metrics (Indicator 2 - Management/Oversight - 100 points total):**
        * Adherence to GAAP standards.
        * Adherence to Federal Financial Requirements.
        * Adherence to LUA Manual.
        * Adherence to School's Own Financial Policies.
        * Enrollment Variance (projections vs. actual).
        * Timely Audit Submission.
    * **Designations:** A school must achieve "Meets Standards" (80+ points) on *both* Indicator 1 and Indicator 2 to receive an overall "Meets Financial Standards" designation.

## Operations Tab

* This tab shows current operations designations, scores, comparison scores, and trends.
* **CPF Relevance (Section III):**
    * **Fundamental Question:** Is the organization effective, compliant, and well-run?
    * **Indicators (Point values vary per measure):**
        * Indicator 1: Educational Program Compliance (e.g., implementing essential features, state/federal requirements, data reporting).
        * Indicator 2: Governance, Ethics, and Transparency (e.g., board policies, Open Meetings/Records, training, budget approval).
        * Indicator 3: Obligations to Students (e.g., rights of all students, students with disabilities, English Learners).
        * Indicator 4: Employer Obligations (e.g., qualifications, background checks, employee rights/civil rights).
        * Indicator 5: School Environment (e.g., facility safety, health requirements, data security).
        * Indicator 6: Additional and Continuing Obligations (e.g., other legal/contractual duties, remedying noncompliance).
    * **Designations:** Based on total points earned across all indicators. Meets (80-100 pts), Approaches (70-79 pts), Does Not Meet (0-69 pts).
